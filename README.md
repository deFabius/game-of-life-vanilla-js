# game-of-life-vanilla-js
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life without using any framework.

After installing the project, use dev task to start an http server and open Chrome on the main page.
This task also starts a number of watchers:
- on html and javascript files to reload the browser
- on scss files to rebuild the stylesheet

```
npm run dev
```
